# Deep Reinforcement Learning
* Implemented SheepRL Dreamer version 3 agent on AWS
* Created gymnasium wrapper to go around the VGC AI env
* Created custom obs space (many versions of this)
* Created supporting files as required by SheepRL (various configs and yamls)
* Prototyped and lightly tested PPO with CleanRL but did not do long runs due to time constraints
* See blog post for more details
