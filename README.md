# File Structure
* Loosely organized by methods ideas tried
    * deep_reinforcement_learning for Deep RL attempts
    * pequil_bot_version_2 for my final submission
        * cleanest and best version of my ideas
    * scrap holds my first submission work, my findings on VGC AI, and my prototyping of various parts. Unfortunately this is poorly organized
* submission_v1 and submission_v2 hold the submissions
