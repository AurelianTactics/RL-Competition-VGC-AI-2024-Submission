Other ideas:
what if I focus on beating prior bot
simplify by only running throuhg 3v3
	randomess and swap on the first action
	store swap dict basically in each run
	only when enough states are gathered allow swaps at lesser levels

only focusing on opp

opp state is:
ttf against agent 1-3, num_moves_revealed, normalized hp, num_pkm remaining


ideally doing a better algo then this. kind of last minute
	issue is need huge number of samples to feel confident in this
	could rely on statistical tests to move past it


steps to do:
	simple dry run
	make sure it works with eval
	write teh bot code as well



prelim-ideas:
focus on the num moves revealed or not
focus on states more likely to see
never go deeper than 2v2

ttf -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
hp normalize: -1, 0, 1, 2
moves revealed: -1, 1, 2, 3, 4

new state

ttf
	a1 to o1, a1 to o2, a2 to o1, a2 to o2 (4 states)
		if 3v2 or 3v2 expand to
		a1 to o3, a2 to o3, a3 to o1-3 (5 states)

	opp is always the 4 states reversed


	HP normalize is
		a1, a2, a3 (if there), o1, o2

	num moves revealed
		only for o1 and o2
			

Gathering the states
	focus on the more likely
		2v2 o1 num moves known is 0 to 4. should be 1 to 4 for active opp bu t not sure I want to take that shortcut
			have like 64% of the state be that and o2 hidden
			for o2 then the remaining num moves revealed
				i mean should probably make 4v4 super unlikely to be revealed
		2v3 and 3v3 and 3v2 can do the same
			but again, really super unlikely many moves are revealed
		maybe just the active moves revealed 0 to 4? or cap the back up mnoves revealed at like 3. seems so unlikely


Filtering the states
	still think doing the 2v2, 2v3, 3v2, 3v3 general set up
	would have to rewrite the filter code
		prod and gather
	woudl have to rewrite the eval code

sorting
	sort agent stuff by hp and key
	opp sort
		no sorting. look at party 0. if revealed use that one. if not don't use part 1. if neither revealed do not revealed
		

issues
	time of course
	not clear on how to do partial reveals
		maybe mask it and update the mask for later states
		or leave the mask there?
		maybe always unmask the highest move power action? and do in descending

possible expansions
	strate of knowing of move used against the opp
